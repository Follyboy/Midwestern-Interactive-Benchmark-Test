<h3>COMMUNICATION SKILLS</h3>
<p>Dear [Customer Name],<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to reach out to let you know that working with you on the Marketing Site Project 
   has been a pleasure. We truly appreciate you and your team. We are at the “About Us” page which is 
   the completion phase of the project and we want to ask for a few more things before we get things done. <br> 
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we need a few photos and a couple of paragraphs for the “About Us” page from your team.
   These paragraphs could be the mission statement which could consist of the vision, purpose, and values of the company.
   The photos could be pictures of your team or projects you have accomplished. These are just opinions for the content of
   your “About Us” page, there might be other ideas your team would like to add and we are on board with your ideas every step
   of the way in order to provide you with the best results. <br>

Yours Sincerely,<br>

<h3>CODE TEST</h3>
<p>This test gave me a refresher on my past experiences with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The toughest part for me was using PHP because I had little to no experience in that area but had a little knowledge about it.
Using PHP to create the “Contact Form” made me research a lot on PHP and after my research I can say that this test has improved 
my knowledge greatly on PHP. And also, I noticed that I could not run my PHP code under index.html, so I had to convert it to index.php. I ran it using Xampp. Other than that, I was good with the rest of the codes because I did a lot of HTML, CSS and 
JavaScript at my last place of work. It took me about 7 hours 47 minutes to complete this code test.
